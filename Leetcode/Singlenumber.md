# Single Element

- In this problem we are given an array,where the array contains duplicate elements and we have to find the element that is unique,i.e., it exists only once in the array.
- In order to solve this we use the XOR gate,which when applied on similar elements gives the result to be zero.
- Here, we apply XOR to all elements in the array, and finally all the elements which are duplicated will be turned to 0,when XOR is applied on them and finally we are left with the unique element or the 'Single Element'.

Consider the following question:

```
Find the single element in the folowing array?
arr=[1,1,4,7,3,4,7,8,8,9,4,9,0,1,0];
```

Code:
``` C

```

Output:
```
